// Implements Lockable & SharedLockable C++14 concepts. Allows for recursion of all calls when the
// first acquisition was exclusive, and recursion of shared access calls whens first acquisition was
// shared. Attempting to acquire exclusive ownership of the mutex when this thread already has
// shared ownership is undefined behavior. Maximum recursion depth is 2^31. Maxium number of
// instances per program is 2^32. This implementation only requires one boost::shared_mutex and a
// per-thread map of access counters, and so will be relatively performant for most use cases.
// Because a boost::shared_mutex is used internally, access to this lock is guaranteed to be fair.
